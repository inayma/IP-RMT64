# WarTek Security & UX Improvements Summary

## ✅ **Completed Security Features**

### 🔐 **1. Access Control & Authentication**

- **✅ Public HomePage Access**: HomePage is accessible to everyone without authentication
- **✅ Protected Post Creation**: Only authenticated users can access CreatePostPage
- **✅ Smart Navigation**: Non-authenticated users see "Login to Create Post" button instead of "Create Post"
- **✅ Post Ownership Authorization**: Users can only edit/delete their own posts via backend validation

### 🛡️ **2. Backend Security Improvements**

- **✅ Post Update Authorization**: Added ownership check in `PostController.update()`
- **✅ Post Delete Authorization**: Added ownership check in `PostController.delete()`
- **✅ Proper Error Handling**: Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized edit/delete attempts
- **✅ Secure API Endpoints**: All modification endpoints require authentication

### 👤 **3. User Ownership Validation**

```javascript
// Backend Authorization Check
if (post.userId !== req.user.id) {
  throw {
    name: "Forbidden",
    message: "You can only edit/delete your own posts",
  };
}
```

## 🎨 **Enhanced User Experience Features**

### 🗳️ **1. Improved Voting System**

- **✅ Bigger, Explicit Voting Buttons**:

  - Clear "UPVOTE" and "DOWNVOTE" labels
  - Circle arrow icons for better visual recognition
  - Larger button size with better spacing

- **✅ Enhanced Vote Display**:

  - Large vote count with color coding (green for positive, red for negative)
  - Separate upvote/downvote breakdown
  - Responsive design across all screen sizes

- **✅ One Vote Per User Logic**:
  - Users can vote up OR down (not both)
  - Clicking same vote removes it (toggle functionality)
  - Clicking opposite vote changes the vote
  - Backend prevents duplicate votes per user

### 🎯 **2. Visual Vote Feedback**

```jsx
// Vote Score with Color Coding
<div style={{ color: post.votes >= 0 ? "#198754" : "#dc3545" }}>
  {post.votes >= 0 ? "+" : ""}
  {post.votes || 0}
</div>
```

### ✏️ **3. Post Management Features**

- **✅ Edit Post Functionality**:

  - Dedicated EditPostPage with form validation
  - Only visible to post owners
  - Maintains original content during editing

- **✅ Delete Post Functionality**:

  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Immediate redirect to homepage after deletion
  - Only available to post owners

- **✅ Owner-Only Controls**:
  - Edit/Delete buttons only show for post owners
  - Visual indicators for post ownership
  - Clean, intuitive button placement

## 🔄 **Voting System Logic**

### **Current User Vote States:**

1. **No Vote**: User can vote up or down
2. **Voted Up**:
   - Click up again → Remove vote
   - Click down → Change to downvote
3. **Voted Down**:
   - Click down again → Remove vote
   - Click up → Change to upvote

### **Vote Count Calculation:**

```javascript
const upvotes = votes.filter((vote) => vote.value === 1).length;
const downvotes = votes.filter((vote) => vote.value === -1).length;
const totalVotes = upvotes - downvotes;
```

- `PostCard.jsx` - Enhanced voting buttons and layout
- `PostDetailPage.jsx` - Bigger vote buttons, edit/delete controls
