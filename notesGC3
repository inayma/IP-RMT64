# 1. Create monorepo root
mkdir wartek && cd wartek
npm init -y

# 2. Add workspaces support
npm pkg set "workspaces[0]"="./backend"
npm pkg set "workspaces[1]"="./frontend"

# 3. Setup backend
mkdir backend && cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors dotenv
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli nodemon

# 4. Initialize Sequelize

# go back root after this
cd ..

my idea: 
- i am into gadget / tech / ai news 
- i want a website combining like reddit but tech news for and from tech / gadget / ai communities. they will write and contribute as an author (like blogging) and the communities will say thumbs up / down about that certain post. 
- also maybe take a look at reddit and kaskus indonesia. 
- the website will be called WarTek from Warung Tekno 
- i want the website to also have ai summarise with API gemini 2.5, with the specific prompt that they can have the sentiment of certain blog topic or just something revolves ai / tech / gadget expert and also give recommendations. 
- i also want to use this API if this helps : https://www.newsapi.ai/documentation?tab=searchArticles 
- Make sure to use sequelize

User:
- username
- email
- password

Post:
- title
- summary (ai)
- description
- votes
- userId

npx sequelize-cli model:generate \
  --name User \
  --attributes username:string,email:string,password:string

npx sequelize-cli model:generate \
  --name Post \
  --attributes title:string,summary:text,description:text,votes:integer,userId:integer

npm install express cors jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
